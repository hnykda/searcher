      <h2 className="mt-4 text-lg font-semibold">Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to my API integration. This Privacy Policy describes the
        handling of data for the API service I provide. As the sole user of this
        service, it&apos;s designed to clarify that no personal or user data is
        collected, stored, shared, or used.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-4 text-lg font-semibold">
        Information Collection and Use
      </h2>
      <p>
        No information is collected through this API. As the sole operator and
        user, I ensure that there is no data collection mechanism within the
        API.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-4 text-lg font-semibold">
        Data Sharing and Disclosure
      </h2>
      <p>
        Since no data is collected, there is no sharing or disclosure of any
        data to any third parties.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-4 text-lg font-semibold">
        Data Retention and Deletion
      </h2>
      <p>Not applicable as no data is retained or stored.</p>

      <h2 className="mt-4 text-lg font-semibold">Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        Given that no data is collected, data security concerns are not
        applicable to this API.

        Changes to Our Privacy Policy
      </h2>
      <p>
        I reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, though
        changes are unlikely due to the nature of this API. Any changes will be
        indicated by an updated revision date.
      </p>

      <p>
        This privacy policy is intended to meet the basic requirements of
        privacy governance, though no specific legal frameworks apply directly
        due to the non-existence of data handling.
      </p>
